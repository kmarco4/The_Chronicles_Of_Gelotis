<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<p>I woke up shivering in a strange, dark room I`ve never been before. There were tubes going down my throat.</p>
<p>Where am I? How did I get here? </p>
<p>I hear a woman scream; he is awake. It was so loud my ears started bleeding. I can`t move.</p>
<p>Dear God, am I paralyzed? What have these people done to me?</p>
<p>As she exits the room, the lights from outside burn my eyes and leaves me blind. I feel myself starting to lose consciousness.</p> 
<p>Who am I? What is my name?</p>
