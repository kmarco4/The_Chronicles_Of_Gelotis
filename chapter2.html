<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<p>I am awake now, floating in a tank of salt water. I see a man, typing on a computer that is connected to the tank. I begin to hear voices in my head.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Gelotis"</p>
<p>"I know this is a lot to take in right now, but you are a lucky man. You should be dead right now, but you were hand picked by the master to be saved and to continue our legacy."</p>
<p>What is he talking about?</p>
<p>"He picked you because of the rare gift you were born with. You have a rare dormant gene that allows you to supress all five senses that makes you have a faster reaction time and heightened sensitivity in the sense you choose."</p>
<p>"We activated this gift and you must learn to control it. We will guide you to your destiny of becoming our new master."</p>
<p>Towards the end, I began to recognize the voice. It was my mother's. She killed herself by swallowing pills as I watched, when I was 13 years old.</p>
<p>My memory is coming back to me. My life is awful. I wish they hadn't saved me.</p>
<p>I began hitting my head against the glass of the tank. I can see it begin to fill with blood.</p>
<p>My mother yells at me.</p>
<p>"Stop!"</p>
<p>The tank begins to shake and I feel myself unable to move.</p>
<p>I hope I am dying.</p>
