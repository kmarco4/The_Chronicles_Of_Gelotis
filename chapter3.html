<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<p>No. This can't be happening.</p>
<p>I did not die.</p>
<p>I wake up in a cushioned room. I find myself in a sapphire jumpsuit with the letter zed embroidered on the chest.</p>
<p>I began to think about all the horrible things I did to people before all of this.</p>
<p>Maybe this is why I'm here. The universe is punishing me for all the pain and suffering I have caused.</p>
<p>A man comes in. He is also wearing the exact same jumpsuit as me.</p>
<p>I couldn't control myself. I attack him. He strikes me to the ground and starts kicking my head. I feel him inject me in the neck with something.</p>
<p>Everything begins to fade away.</p>
